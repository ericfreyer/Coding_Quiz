I have created a simple, working coding quiz, with five questions. When the user clicks on the continue button the timer starts and the questions begin. When a question is answered correctly points and time are added, and when questions are answered incorrectly then points and time are subtracted. After getting through the five questions, the user is taken to a second page where they can record their score. The scores are automatically arranged from highest to lowest, and they should stay save within the users local storage until its cleared.
